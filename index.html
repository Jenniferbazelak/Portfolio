                <p>Welcome to my portfolio page! I'm a web developer in Austin, TX. In my previous career, I was a top sales
                    consultant, nine times over. I worked for a builder and sold new homes for 6 years. Before my sales career,
                    I was a successful middle school math teacher. With this unique, career background, I'm able to leverage
                    experience from previous work fields to create a unique perspective for user-based technologies. </p>
                <br>

                <p>I enjoy creative, problem solving while taking on the task at hand and ultimately seeing it through to completion.
                    I excels at both browser based technologies and server side development. I perform under pressure and
                    I'm a great communicator that works well in a group or independently. Outside of web developing, I stay
                    busy spending time with my husband, two daughters and 3 doggers.</p>
